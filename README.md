Bloxstrap Player Pro is an unofficial "extension" for Roblox modded with Bloxstrap. This "extension" makes you use the fast web version of Roblox instead of the laggy desktop one. (Original version for normal Roblox: https://github.com/Axolotl9922/Roblox-Player-Pro)

# Preparations
1. Install Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/next-steps.html)
   (Or run "Winget install Google.Chrome")
2. Enable "Don't exit to desktop app" in the Bloxstrap menu
   This will allow you to leave the experience without getting back to the laggy Roblox desktop app.
   To do this go to the Bloxstap menu, click Integrations, and under the Activity tracking tab you should see the setting. It is turned off by default, so click it to enable it and then save your settings!
   
# How to use 
It is straightforward, follow the instructions below!

## (Optional) Add Roblox Chrome extensions
Before you start using the web version of Roblox, you can customize it using extensions. Here are some examples:  
Rogold - http://www.rogold.live                        
Ropro - http://www.ropro.io                        
BTRoblox - https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hbkpclpemjeibhioopcebchdmohaieln                             

## 1. Double-click on the .exe file
This will open up Roblox inside the Chrome kiosk. From here you can join any experience.
### Press ctrl+alt+y to quit Chrome (If you close Chrome, you close the .exe file so reopen it to relaunch the Roblox web version.)

## (Optional) Add the Bloxstrap Player Pro to startup
By doing this, you won't have to always open the Py file because it will automatically open when you turn on your computer.
To do this you need to press Win+r. This will open up run. Now you should type in "shell:startup" and hit enter. Now you have to copy Bloxstrap Player Pro.exe to the folder that it just opened.
